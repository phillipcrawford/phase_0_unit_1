<p># U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection</p>

<p>* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?</p>
<p>    The DOM connects html to other files used by a website. DOM makes html not static. It reads the tags as objects and allows for nesting of tags. The DOM allows for events properties and methods.</p>
<p>* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?</p>
<p>    Structurally, they were not very different.</p>
<p>* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?</p>
<p>dev tools itself is fine, but the codeschool tutorial was poorly put together and often times misleading. It took me a long time to finish that tutorial</p>
<p>* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?</p>
<p>    The concepts behind dev tools were clear to me, it was during the actual completion of the exercise I had aha moments.</p>
<p>* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</p>
<p>    No, just much trial and error on codeschool</p>
