# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://phillipcrawford.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
Good design is simple and has a good flow. Grids are good, I went for a grid approach. It takes time and lots of trial and error to get the concepts down.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
It was fun, but I was rushed for time ( I realized was doing my reflections wrong and had to redo them before due time). So I was unable to complete what I had wireframed in time. But yes it was fun, I enjoyed the trial and error aspect.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
I wanted to make a grid. I couldn't figure out how to get them all evenly spaced in time. I'm signing up for teamtreehouse's free trial because they were begining to get into this.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
Headers and footers. Full responsive design.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
It was difficult, this is still very much a work in progress, I want to improve it ASAP, but am crammed for time right now.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Further along teamtreehouse's tutorial will help me.
