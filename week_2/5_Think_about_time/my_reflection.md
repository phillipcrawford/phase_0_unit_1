# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
Learning when to move on and recognize that it's ok that a resource hasn't fully illuminated a concept for me. I spent a lot of time on Chrome dev tools this week, trying to figure things out on my own, when I probably should have asked when I was confused. I'm self-concious about asking for help too often, I'm willing to do it, but worried my question will seem stupid. I am juggling my desire for 3 things. 1, to really know the materials assigned in phase 0 inside and out (which I can't). 2 to pass my computer science classes at community college. 3 have a little bit of me time to stay sane.
* How will you combat that? 
Move on after working on one thing for 4 hours. 4 is too long. 
* What techniques will you try?
Asking for help even when I think my question is too simple and will make me look dumb.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
Keep at it day in day out. Sometimes my computer science classes will say they have 12 hours of work for me and it takes me 20. I already am counting on assignments taking longer than I thought they would. I also haven't worked out in 2 weeks. Need to get back at it.
