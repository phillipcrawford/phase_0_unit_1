# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
    Responsive design is a site with relative widths between the contents and Media Queries. I do like responsive websites. Prior to this exercise I didn't exactly know what responsive design was. I now realize that I regard websites as rudimentary if they are not responsive or at least adaptive. Definately best practice to make a website responsive so it works on all screen sizes.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
    By providing many different screen sizes, web design needs to scale to all screen sizes. 
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
    Aural or braille media is catered to the visually impaired
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
    The tutorials very clear, but not very indepth. I learned most of what I learned about responsive design through adding min-widths in different sections of CSS and through trial and error discovering the consequences. I still don't really understand Media Queries. If I was blind, how do I make the braille version of the site load for me?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
