PSEUDO CODE / WIREFRAMING

Ideas: Something similar to dbc2.htlm / not nec a footer, but two side by side divs with a pics, etc.
(float side by side). so, two tables of the about us section, in a table (written in p) subjects about pp
drive,

Create a new section <div> for Driver
-purpose (<p>)
-responsibility

__________________________

Need two divs, floated next to each other, both need to be nested inside a 
bigger div, check new method for floating two divs.

__________________________

So, 2 floating divs next to each other - maybe nested in a div.
After (below that) is the div with the content. Use phillip's image and scott's
image for their respective top divs including small blurb,

Content below includes driver vs navigator and why pair programming is important. 
Maybe bring in aspects of the collabritve nature of today's dev. community.

Gives a very real work-place like experience unlink working alone at home.
________
make blurb 1 or at most 2 sentences
pic, then below that is text, not side to side othewise would need another nested
amd float!

        <h3>pair programming and its role in the developer community</h3></center>
            <p id="padding">Pair programing is a method used to collaborate simultaneously (and remotely) on the same project. Common platform for pair programming typically involve two individuals connecting to an interactive that allows a language document to be created, edited and rendered.</p>
            <p id="padding">The role of the navigator is to sustain a bird's eye view of the implementation, the structure and advises the driver as to the methods that should be used in a particular project. The navigator acts as a compass to the driver.</p>
            <p id="padding">The driver plays the role of doer. It is the driver's responsibilty to type the code as per the approaches given by the navigator. It is important that the driver be familiar with the chosen language and that he or she does not type anything without prior guidance from the navigator. In other words, communication in all aspects of collaboritive programming is of great importance. </p>

        <center><h3>Scott & Phillip's reflections on pair programming</h3></center>        
        <p id="padding2">Pairing for the first time was a really great experience as the act of simply sharing each other's ideas on perspectives really helps to expand one's own context. It's also great practice and we were really able to compliment each other's strengths.<br><br>Phillip and I have talked about the fact that we did indeed take longer than was probably necessary - and that if we had wanted to we couldn've thrown somthing up quicker - but we both felt it was really the practice of the navigator and driver relationship that seemed most pertinent for this excercise.
