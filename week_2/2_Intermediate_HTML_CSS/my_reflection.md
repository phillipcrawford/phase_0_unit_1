# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
 

Web standards are good because they define best practices. These best practices can make a page load faster, be more responsive, etc. Web standards sort of make sense to me. I don't see how header, footer, article , or section are  different from pre-named classes. If you use 2 sections that have exact same structure, but want different CSS for each of them, your still gonna need to make divs. If theses 2 sections didn't have same structure, we could use or specify multiple selectors in the CSS, the first of which would be section. I checked out chrome, firefox, and I/E. The site loaded the same in all three. http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_links.asp taught me how to bookmark within a website.
