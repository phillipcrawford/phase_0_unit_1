# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
    <p>Web standards are good because they define best practices. These best practices can make a page load faster, be more responsive, etc.</p> 
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
    <p>Web standards sort of make sense to me. I don't see how header, footer, article , or section are  different from pre-named classes. If you use 2 sections that have exact same structure, but want different CSS for each of them, your still gonna need to make divs. If theses 2 sections didn't have same structure, we could use or specify multiple selectors in the CSS, the first of which would be section.</p>
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
    <p>They do some auto-placement</p>
* Why is reset.css necessary?
    <p>reset.css overrides default html settings. Html has some style, such as links being blue prior to being clicked, or padding between headings.</p>
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
    <p>I checked out chrome, firefox, and I/E. The site loaded the same in all three.</p>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

    <p>http://www.cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/ explained why we need a reset.css instead of just overwriting html styles in one CSS file. </p>
